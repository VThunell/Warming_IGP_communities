# Warming_IGP_communities

Here you'll contains data and R code for plotting the efects of wamring on IGP communities.

To use my model directlu in MatCont, copy and paste the different sections (of System and User functions) of the file "MatCont_model_Code" into the MatCont GUI. I have used MatCont version 6p6 and suggest using that same version for successfully reproducing my data.

The data is .mat files produced when doing continuations in MatCont. If you wish to access this data, I suggest using my plotting code in this repository for reading the data into R and looking at it from there, read it with Matlab or exporting it from R to a format of your choice. The output produced in MatCont lacks names on columns and rows making them difficult to read at first glance. For information on the struture of MatCont output, see chapter 4.2 in the MatCont Manual:
