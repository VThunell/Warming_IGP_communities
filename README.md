# Warming_IGP_communities

This repository gives you model code, output data and R code for plotting the effects of warming on ontogentic omnivore IGP communities.

To use my model directly in MatCont, copy and paste the different sections (for System and User functions) of the file "MatCont_model_Code" ("MatCont_model_Code_AppA5" for model code to appendix A5) into the MatCont GUI. I have used MatCont version 6p6 and suggest using that same version for successfully reproducing my data.

The data is .mat files produced when doing continuations in MatCont. If you wish to access this data, I suggest using my plotting code in this repository for reading the data into R and looking at it from there, read it with Matlab or exporting it from R to a format of your choice. The output produced in MatCont lacks names on columns and rows making them difficult to read at first glance. For information on the structure of MatCont output, see chapter 4.2 in the MatCont Manual:
